# Learn-SQL
Here are some useful notes I took when I was/still am learning SQL, and I would love to share them with everyone.
There are also answer sheets to SQLZoo tutorials(http://sqlzoo.net/). SQLZoo provides awesome tutorials and quizs of SQL, but it is a little tricky to see the answers of their tutorials.
You can add 'answer=1' to the URL to enable the cheat mode, I also uploaded my own version of answers so it might be different from theirs.
