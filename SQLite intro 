# How to use SQLite on Mac
# SQLite in pre-installed on Mac, so we actually don't even have to download it ! 

1. open terminal window

2. navigate to a directory of your choice 
	(pwd: output the path of current working directory
	 ls: view files in the directory)
	 
3. make a new folder in the chosen directory
	$ mkdir sqlite
	
4. create a new database 
	$ sqlite3 test.db
	SQLite version 3.7.13 2012-07-17 17:46:21
	Enter ".help" for instructions
	Enter SQL statements terminated with a ";"
	sqlite> 
	
5. now you are in the database test.db, lets try to create a new table called first with two column a and b 
	sqlite> create table first (a int, b string); 
	
6. Let's check the structure of the table 
	sqlite> .schema
	CREATE TABLE first (a int, b string);
	
7. now we can add values into the table first
	sqlite> insert into first (a, b) values (1, "hello");
	
8. we can view data by doing
	sqlite> select * from first;
	1|hello
	
9. To quit sqlite
	sqlite> .quit
	
10. Now you are back to the sqlite folder, we can check if the test.db is there. 
	$ls 
	test.db
